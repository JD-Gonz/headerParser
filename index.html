    <h1>Request Header Parser</h1>
    <p>A request header parser is a tool that extracts information from the headers of an HTTP request. The headers contain metadata about the request, such as the user agent, the client's IP address, and the accepted content types. By analyzing the headers, a request header parser can provide information about the client that sent the request, such as the browser or operating system being used.</p>
    <h2>Example Header</h2>
    <p>Here is an example of an HTTP request header:</p>
    <pre>
      GET /example HTTP/1.1
      Host: www.example.com
      User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.3
      Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
      Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, sdch
      Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8
      Cookie: _ga=GA1.2.1876104121.1495236684; _gid=GA1.2.1292383122.1495236684
    </pre>
    <p>From this header, we can extract information about the client's user agent (which browser and operating system they are using), as well as their preferred content types and encoding methods.</p>
